#Infrastructure design
Infrastructure design for a health application features a robust three-tier architecture, comprising distinct front-end, back-end, and database layers, each hosted within dedicated Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and private subnets to bolster security. Global Accelerator is employed to ensure worldwide high availability and low-latency connections, enhancing user experience. The traffic flow starts with CloudFront, which optimizes content delivery globally, and then passes through AWS WAF for web application security. Global Accelerator routes traffic to Elastic Beanstalk, which is configured with an auto-scaling group to handle varying loads efficiently. Transit Gateway facilitates secure communication between the back-end application and external services, safeguarding data integrity and confidentiality. API Gateway acts as the entry point for backend services, invoking AWS Lambda functions that handle application logic and interact with Amazon RDS for relational database management, ensuring efficient data storage and management. Amazon S3 is integrated not just for object storage but also for data staging and analytics, enhancing the infrastructure's resilience. AWS IAM enforces robust access control, and AWS Key Vault centralizes key management, heightening security. For comprehensive monitoring and audit trails, AWS CloudWatch and CloudTrail are utilized, respectively. To achieve a truly fortified setup, adherence to HIPAA compliance, implementation of data encryption, establishment of disaster recovery protocols, and regular audits remain imperative to uphold the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive health data.3 tier strategies for hospital application.

 
##CloudFront 
It is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds. CloudFront integrates with other AWS services to provide a seamless, scalable solution for delivering content to end-users. By caching content at edge locations worldwide, CloudFront reduces latency and improves performance, ensuring that users receive content from the closest server. Additionally, CloudFront includes features such as AWS Shield for DDoS protection, AWS WAF for web application firewall capabilities, enhance security with SSL/TLS encryption and the ability to serve dynamic content securely and efficiently.
To ensure encryption of PHI while in transit with CloudFront, customers must configure CloudFront to use HTTPS end-to-end from the origin to the viewer.
##Route 53
Highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service designed to route end-user requests to your application endpoints efficiently. Route 53 translates human-readable domain names into the IP addresses that computers use to communicate with each other. It supports various routing policies, including simple routing, failover, geolocation, and latency-based routing, ensuring optimal routing of user traffic. Additionally, Route 53 provides health checks to monitor the health of your application endpoints, automatically rerouting traffic away from unhealthy instances to maintain high availability and reliability.
Route53 is connected to WAF (Web Application Firewall) with Internal Load balancer, with this public network are avoided, ACM (private security authority) is used to encrypt data in REST using HTTPS.
No PHI should be stored in any resource names or tags within Amazon Route 53 as there is no support for encrypting such data.
##IAM
With IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow or deny access to AWS resources. IAM provides fine-grained control over user access, enabling you to enforce the principle of least privilege by granting only the necessary permissions required for users to perform their tasks. IAM also supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) for an added layer of security, ensuring that only authorized users can access your AWS environment.
##VPC
It is a service that lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. VPC gives you full control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of IP address ranges, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. With VPC, you can isolate your applications and resources for enhanced security, control inbound and outbound traffic using security groups and network ACLs, and establish secure connections to your on-premises data centers or other VPCs using VPN connections or AWS Direct Connect. VPC provides the foundational network infrastructure for deploying secure and scalable applications in the AWS cloud.
4 VPC is created in different availability zones for Web, Backend and database tier.
VPC Flow Logs that keeps track of who's coming in and out, making sure only the right people can access your sensitive data, like medical records.
##Global Accelerator
Amazon Global Accelerator is a network service that enhances the availability and performance of applications with global users by leveraging the extensive AWS global network infrastructure. It routes user traffic through AWS edge locations to ensure low-latency connections and high availability, automatically redirecting traffic to healthy endpoints.
 By providing a single static entry point for applications worldwide, Global Accelerator improves performance and reliability compared to traditional load balancers, which are typically regional. It uses Anycast IPs and the AWS backbone network to bring user traffic onto the AWS network faster, reducing the number of hops across the public internet. This results in optimized routes, reduced latency, and a superior user experience for globally distributed applications.
##Aws Beanstalk
Easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services. With Elastic Beanstalk, you simply upload your code, and the service automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto-scaling to application health monitoring. Elastic Beanstalk supports a variety of platforms, including Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker, making it versatile for different types of applications. It provides a managed environment that abstracts the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on writing code while Elastic Beanstalk takes care of the operational aspects.
customers must ensure that Personal Health Information (PHI) is not included in inappropriate fields, such as the name field, to maintain compliance.
##Aws Lambda
It is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda automatically scales your application by running code in response to events, such as changes to data in an S3 bucket or updates to a DynamoDB table. You simply upload your code, and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. This service is ideal for building event-driven architectures, as it integrates seamlessly with other AWS services and allows you to run code in response to triggers without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
Performs CRUD operations on a database and uploads it to Lambda, creating Lambda functions.
##API Gateway
API Gateway handles incoming requests by invoking the appropriate Lambda function, which processes the request and returns a response. The API Gateway then sends the response back to the client.
##AWS CloudTrail 
It is a service that enables governance, compliance, and operational and risk auditing of your AWS account. It continuously logs and monitors account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure. CloudTrail records API calls made on your account, capturing details such as the identity of the caller, the time of the call, the source IP address, and the parameters of the request. This comprehensive logging allows for detailed auditing of changes and activities, helping to detect unusual behavior and ensuring that your AWS environment complies with internal policies and regulatory standards. CloudTrail logs are invaluable for troubleshooting, security analysis, and tracking changes across your AWS resources.

##AWS CloudWatch 
It is a monitoring and observability service that provides data and actionable insights to monitor your applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health.
